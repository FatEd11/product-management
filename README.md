# Product Management docs

##Intro

I love building products. More important though: I love building **great** products. Even more important: I love building great products **well**.

By that I mean: identifying the best solution for a given problem; and building it in the most efficient way.

I mean **product management**.

This repository contains a set of documents I've collected together on product management. They are templates and guides I've assembled from various blogs and my own head.

The aim of the collection is to inform you (or me) on a process for product management. And all it's nefarious ways...

Please also check out [my blog](http://blog.lumbrjack.com) for more discussion on all this nonsense. 

##Structure

I've arranged them in steps:

1. Defining the problem. These docs focus on customer **interviews**, and plans.
1. Solving the problem. These docs focus on the actual **process** of building, shipping and testing a product.
1. Measuring success. Finally, these docs focus on **analytics**, the PM's BFF.

I've provided the docs in MD format only to allow for editing.

## Future

I will add to this repo whenever I find, or figure out, something useful.

## Contributing

I welcome and encourage anyone to add to, update, or critique these documents. 

Please add issues, pull requests as you feel appropriate.

We can all create a proper comprehensive framework for building great products.
